# Siren Detector

I have been working with embedded systems for a very long time. For my senior project in college, I cobbled together a run tracker by connecting a Palm Pilot together with a Garmin GPS. I am by no means an expert, but I have managed to keep up with the different embedded platforms as they have emerged. When it comes to Machine Learning (ML) though, I am much more of a beginner, as I suspect a lot of folks on the embedded side are. Adding ML to embedded devices has a lot of potential though (as we outlined here), and has become mature enough were it can start being useful and not just a novelty. This blog post will walk through a project to build a wireless sensor that can detect sirens using ML. The core of what is presented here can be extended to other projects.

## Project Goals
Working from home can you come to some new realizations. For me, one of those was, “Man, there sure are a lot of sirens”. This happened to coincide with my current fascination with adding ML to sensors, and from this, a project was born. The formal project goal was to build a sensor that can accurately count how times sirens could be heard during a day, and see how that day compares to other days in the week.

While the geneses of the project was rather whimsical, there are practical applications. For the most part, whenever you hear a siren it is because something happened. If you hear a siren for a long time, at a loud volume, the event is probably happening nearby. Integrating siren detection into security camera can give you a pulse of the neighborhood. 

There is also a lot of interest in identifying the sources of urban sounds. Excessive noise can have a real impact on quality of life. The Sound of New York City project is a research effort to catalog and map the sources of urban noise, including sirens. 

## Related work
While there is a lot of interest and effort going into looking at understanding urban noise, it has been mostly focused on post processing recordings. This is understandable because it only recently has become possible to begin looking at doing this completely on-device. Jon Norby examined doing on-device classification of 10 common sound class using an embedded device in his master thesis. He found that it was possible to run an optimized model within the processing and memory constraints of an embedded device. While there was some reduction in accuracy, it would work well enough to provide an understanding of the largest contributors to overall noise throughout a span of time. Testing for this work was performed in the lab. As we discovered, real world testing is a critical element of evaluating an approach.
